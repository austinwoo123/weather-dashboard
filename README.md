# Weather-Dashboard
Our assignment was to retrieve data from another application's API and use it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs give developers access to their data andd functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. We needed to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started
1. Copy the repo from GitLab using your ssh key
2. Run Git bash
3. Type in "code ." to open Visual Studios Code
4. Open the index.html, script.js, and style.css file

## Technologies Used
- HTML -used to create elements on the DOM
- CSS- styles html elements on page
- Git- version control system to track changes to source code
- GitHub- hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages
- BootStrap CSS Framework- Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites using front-end open source toolkit, featuring SASS variables and mixins, responsive grid system, and prebuilt components.
- JavaScript- Programming language that is used to prompt the user and generate a random password based on the user's inputs. 
- jQuery- jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.
-Server-Side-API-A server-side web API is a programmatic interface consisting of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined requestâ€“response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML

## Code Snippet
```
<div class="container-fluid">

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4 bg-light ">
                <h2> <strong>Search for a City: </strong> </h2>
                <input class="form-control" id="search-city" type="text">
                <!--Search Button goes here-->
                <button class="btn bg-primary text-light" id="search-button">
                    <h6>Search</h6>
                </button>
                <!--Search History of cities goes heres-->
                <u1 class="list-group">


                </u1>
            </div>
```
This code shows how I made the search bar with an input text area where the user can enter a specific city to find the current and 5 day forecast. There is also an area for the search history that is represented as "list-group."
